# Password Generator Starter Code

#This application allows us to generate a random password with the use of uppercase and lowercase letters along with numbers and special characters. 

#With the use of javascript we create an array with the alphabet, numbers 0-9 and special characters. We then prompt our users to see if they would like to use any of the options within their password. 

#Once their selection is made, the application will mark a true or false for any of the selected answers and generate a password.

#Here is a sample of a randomly generated password with all the selections being true. Links to the application are available below.
